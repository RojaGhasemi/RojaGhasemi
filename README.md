###  Brain Tumor Detection using Local Features Extraction and Fuzzy Approach from MRI Images (https://github.com/yourusername/project3)
- **Description**: In this research, an automated method for finding the exact range of the abnormal brain region in an MRI image has been investigated. This algorithm is based on fuzzy fragmentation that is used to detect a tumor in a brain medical device. The fuzzy fragmentation algorithm has the ability to quickly diagnose areas with heterogeneous and asymmetric tissue in a medical image. In order to extract the feature from the Gabor filter, it is a powerful method for extracting image texture. The PCA algorithm has been used to select useful features. In the end, SVM has been used to categorize the extracted features and tumor detection.
